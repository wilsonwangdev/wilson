## FFI(Foreign Function Interface)

FFI (Foreign Function Interface) is the bridge that allows a program in one language to invoke functions, use data types, and link libraries written in a different language.

> It relies on a shared ABI (calling conventions, type layouts, name mangling) so both sides agree on how arguments and return values are passed and how memory is represented.

## ABI(Application Bianry Interface)

An ABI (Application Binary Interface) is the contract that lets separately compiled programs and libraries work together at the machine-code level.

> It specifies details like function calling conventions, register usage, stack layout, how integers/floats/structs are represented in memory, name mangling, and how symbols are linked and loaded.
